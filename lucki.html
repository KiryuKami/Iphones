     <p>This is the iPhone 8, which Apple released in September 2017, and it represented a major turning point in the brand's smartphone line. The iPhone 8 came with a glass design that oozes class and elegance, especially with its 4.7-inch Retina HD display backed up by a very strong aerospace-grade aluminum frame that comes in three colors of Silver, Space Gray, and Gold. The device was powered by A11 Bionic chip with neural engine technology to offer better performance and machine learning capabilities.
      One unique feature that stood out on the iPhone 8 was its vastly improved 12-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization and a larger sensor for better low light photography. Moreover, it could support capturing of videos at 4K resolution packed at an amazing speed of 60 frames per second hence making it a perfect choice for those who love capturing quality photos and videos. Asides from this, the other big upgrade was in front facing camera as this offered more detailing on selfie-shooting by adding extra pixels to make face sharper and supporting new Portrait mode for professional pictures.
      The arrival of wireless charging accompanying the release of iPhone 8 was made possible due to glass back. This, among other features such as water resistance as well as dust resistance contributed to enhancing overall usability as well as sturdiness of this phone.      
       In summary, the iPhone 8 combined a stylish design, powerful performance, advanced camera capabilities, and new features like wireless charging, making it a noteworthy addition to Apple's lineup and a popular choice for users seeking a reliable and feature-rich smartphone experience.</p>
