     <p>The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the generation of iPhone and succeeded the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s, and Preceding both the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. It was revealed to the public at a press event on September 12, 2012, and was later released to the public on September 21. 2012. He iPhone 5 was he first iPhone in a long line of phones made by apple being released in September and to this day apple still announces and releases a new phone every September. It was the last Phone designed by Steve Jobs before his death and The Fist to be designed and released by Tim cook. The iPhone 5 featured major upgrades and design changes in comparison to previous phones. These changes included an aluminum-based body which made the phone sleeker and lighter (it also looks better). A taller 4-inch screen compared to the with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and the new Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE Support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connecter which replaced and is better than the old 30-pin design. It was also the second iPhone to include the new Sony-made 8 MP camera. Apple discontinued it by 2013 but its impact on the industry canâ€™t be denied and soon It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5C; the 5C internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supported IOS 7, 8 ,9 and 10. The iPhone 5 did not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S.   </p>
