     <p>Apple’s smartphone design and technology went through a revolutionary change, starting in November 2017. It had an outstanding 5.8-inch Super Retina display that went from side to side and employed OLED technology for bright colors and deep blacks. For convenient security with device unlocking, the traditional home button was remodeled into Face ID—the facial recognition system by Apple as an appellation for bezel-less display that was debuted in iPhone X. 
      A11 Bionic chip containing neural engine did an incredible job on iPhone X delivering augmented reality capabilities. A dual-camera system at the back consisted of a wide-angle camera having a 12-megapixel sensor on it, as well as a telephoto lens featuring optical image stabilization. All this made Portrait mode possible together with shooting 4K videos at sixty frames per second thus increasing overall camera quality.
      
      The device was not only beautiful due to the glass back panel used for wireless charging on the iPhone X but also practical. Additionally, it had a frame made of stainless steel of surgical grade that is durable and has a high quality feel. Without a home button gestures became more intuitive improving user experience.      With an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, the iPhone X offered improved durability. Its elegant design, innovative features, and emphasis on facial recognition as the primary means of authentication solidified the device's position as a flagship model, influencing subsequent iPhone iterations. The iPhone X marked a milestone in Apple's design philosophy, setting the stage for the evolution of future iPhones.</p>
